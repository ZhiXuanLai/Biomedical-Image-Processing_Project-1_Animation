Project 1 Request: MRI image animation

Suppose that I = {I[m, n], m, n = 0, 1, . . . , 255} is a 256 Ã— 256 raw image, (mri-a.256). The pixel value is between [0, 255].
Please design an animation, i.e., a series of images, that image sequences show the given image fading away and eventually disappear.
The image transformations are limited to the affine transforms discussed.
Provide the idea and algorithm that you achieve this special effect in detail.
You can store output images one-by-one into a stack and then use MatLab, imageJ, or other software packages to generate an animation using the image results.
